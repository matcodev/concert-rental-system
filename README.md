Final Test in Python. Use Numpy and functions for create a custom menu. Duoc UC.-

Hi! 
This is a custom menu for Final Test in Duoc UC.
For this test, it is requested to apply two-dimensional and three-dimensional lists using the Numpy library.
So, if you want to download and use this application, you must have Numpy installed (try pip or conda before installing numpy).

If you don't know how to install Numpy, go to the console and type:
> pip install numpy

Thank you!
